during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move &amp; scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

                                        I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Some of the voices are annoying .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                  My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n5                                                                                                                                            I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\n7                    The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                      I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\n9                                                                                                       I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n14

                                                                                                                                                                     Also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .\\n16

                                                                                                            The voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .\\n18                                                                                                                                                   At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                  It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                            On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n23                                                              Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n24                                                                                                The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And the voice and streets match perfectly .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                   the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n27                                                                                                                                              I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n28

accurate .\\n29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                                                                          The voices seem too robotic .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                 Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                    So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35

                                                                                                                                                                                                              I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39

voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                      I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                          Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                           The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                 Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                                                                     From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n79                                                                                                                                                              The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n80                                                                                                                                                          After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\n81                                                                                                                                           VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING &amp; THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH &amp; HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                   Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n84                                                 I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice

with a king bed, and a truly claustrophobic bathroom .\\n28

arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38



was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43

fluffy towels .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

.\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

                                                                                                                                                                             We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

  The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n62

different room .\\n63

                                                                                                                         Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65

linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

etc .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n73

decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76

us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

really say about this, is update the Firm Ware straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                   Once you have the unit, you'll want to update the maps .\\n40                                                                                                                                                               Once receiving the unit, you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days .\\n41

your route in seconds .\\n43                                                                                                                                         I discovered that I need it while trying to register the device and or to get updated maps at the Garmin website .\\n44

                          I have no need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .\\n50                                                                                                                  The only nitpick disappointment was when I downloaded the free 2010

                                                         i hate itunes, but it seems to be a necessary evil in order to tag say a video as music and not a movie, so though i originally started with 3rd party apps for syncing i have since switched to itunes .\\n25

more able than its one, year, old  The iPod gains many incremental improvements, including a brighter screen and better video battery life, but probably the most appealing aspect is the tantalizing

minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

doesn't shift correctly, and it has almost caused me to get into an accident twice .\\n7

                                                                                                                                                                         The voice prompts and maps are wonderful especially when driving after dark .\\n0                                                                                                                                                                               I also thought the the voice prompts of the 750 where more pleasant sounding than the 255w's .\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                           The 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                  I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Some of the voices are annoying .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                  My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n5                                                                                                                                            I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\n7                    The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                      I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\n9                                                                                                       I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You have your choice of several languages and voices .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                      Also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                         For instance, you can change the voice of the GPS .\\n17                                                                                                                                                                     The voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .\\n18                                                                                                                                                   At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                  It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                            On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n23                                                              Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n24                                                                                                The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And the voice and streets match perfectly .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                   the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n27                                                                                                                                              I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                           It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voices seem too robotic .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                 Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                    So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                    the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality

    The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66

                                                           Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68

                                                               I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74

adequate .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                           The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n77

                                                                                                                                                                           From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n79                                                                                                                                                              The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n80                                                                                                                                                          After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\n81                                                                                                                                           VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .\\n83

                                         I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85

                            The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                     The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .  \n",

counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47

so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49

outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

shower .\\n54

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

room is not the most modern room but there was tons of space especially in the bathroom .\\n60

the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

                                                                                                                                                                                           The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

                                            Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67

the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

hitting you no joke !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

little dated .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                        The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n75

from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76

thing to consider was that I paid $50 less for the 750 and it came with the FM transmitter cable and a USB cord to connect it to your computer for updates and downloads .\\n0                                                                                                                                                                                                update and reroute much _more_ quickly than my other GPS   .\\n1                                                                                                       UPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .\\n2

look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n4

from another site that was cheaper by $25 and they told me that I needed to buy a memory card to download map updates .\\n6                                                                                                                                         Another big name site did the same thing and told me that I would have to pay Garmin to update to the latest maps .\\n7                                                                                 The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n8                                                                              Finally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends .\\n9

.\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                         The map

                               I have Comcast cable Internet and a quad, core PC with 4gb of ram and the map update took a little over an hour to download and install .\\n14

                                           It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\n35

                                                                                                                                                                        I also like the way that it connects to the internet   to update all of its maps .\\n37                                                                                                  All I can really say about this, is update the Firm Ware straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\n39

the unit, you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days .\\n41                                                                                                                       One guy posted on the forum that he had an older device and paid to update to the 2009 map 12 hours before the 2010 map was posted .\\n42

need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .\\n50

music and not a movie, so though i originally started with 3rd party apps for syncing i have since switched to itunes .\\n25

during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move &amp; scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

          The transmission doesn't shift correctly, and it has almost caused me to get into an accident twice .\\n7

                                                     Unlike the common concerns with the transmission, all of my concerns problems are with everything other than the drivetrain .\\n9

be desired .\\n7                    The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for

responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little

voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13

is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n19

                                   Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n22

                                          Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n24                                                                                                The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25

        I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n28

accurate .\\n29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                                                                          The voices seem too robotic .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n33

                                                                                                                                                                              So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35

     I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39

voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying

                                                                                   The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66

                                                                                       Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68

                                                                                               I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74

sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                           The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n77

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n79                                                                                                                                                              The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n80

communication .\\n81                                                                                                                                           VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING &amp;

desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n84                                                 I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85

clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                     The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .</td>\n",

arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43

fluffy towels .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46

the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

.\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70

                                                        The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

first bought it from another site that was cheaper by $25 and they told me that I needed to buy a memory card to download map updates .\\n6

instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n8                                                                              Finally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not

really say about this, is update the Firm Ware straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers

minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

doesn't shift correctly, and it has almost caused me to get into an accident twice .\\n7

everything the car offers except the common issue of the transmission that doesn't want to seem to work when you need it .\\n8

serious test drive under varying conditions and actually experience transmission hesitations and the mediocre acceleration performance .\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                         The voice prompts and maps are wonderful especially when driving after dark .\\n0                                                                                                                                                                               I also thought the the voice prompts of the 750 where more pleasant sounding than the 255w's .\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                           The 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                  I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Some of the voices are annoying .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                  My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n5                                                                                                                                            I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\n7                    The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                      I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\n9                                                                                                       I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You have your choice of several languages and voices .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                      Also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                         For instance, you can change the voice of the GPS .\\n17                                                                                                                                                                     The voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .\\n18                                                                                                                                                   At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                  It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                            On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n23                                                              Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n24                                                                                                The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 And the voice and streets match perfectly .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                   the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n27                                                                                                                                              I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                           It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voices seem too robotic .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n33

                                                                                                                                              So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                    the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                      I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74

adequate .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                           The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n77

might only be one voice .\\n79                                                                                                                                                              The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n80                                                                                                                                                          After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\n81

ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .\\n83

                                         I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85

                            The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n87

counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38



                                           The bathroom was large and private .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n53

shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

                Bathrooms were also very nice .\\n57

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

                                     Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65

thing to consider was that I paid $50 less for the 750 and it came with the FM transmitter cable and a USB cord to connect it to your computer for updates and downloads .\\n0

elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .\\n2

look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n4

from another site that was cheaper by $25 and they told me that I needed to buy a memory card to download map updates .\\n6                                                                                                                                         Another big name site did the same thing and told me that I would have to pay Garmin to update to the latest maps .\\n7                                                                                 The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n8                                                                              Finally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends .\\n9

.\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                         The map

                               I have Comcast cable Internet and a quad, core PC with 4gb of ram and the map update took a little over an hour to download and install .\\n14

                                           It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\n35

                                                                                                                                I discovered that I need it while trying to register the device and or to get updated maps at the Garmin website .\\n44                                                                                                                                            More often than not, the estimated arrival time is updated 1, 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .\\n45

                                                                                                         I plan to wait almost the full 60 days to get the latest update, then probably never purchase an update .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                              By the time it needs a new update the unit will be obsolete .\\n48

need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .\\n50

                             Getting the prompted software update might have corrected that .\\n52

a 2GB map update and 3 hours to install the program to the GPS .\\n55
